### Business Task

Cyclistic is a bike-share company that has a both a subscription model and a pay-as-you-ride model. Its subscribers are called *members* and are more profitable than *casual* users of the service.

The objective of this analysis is to dig into the last 12 months of Cyclistic's data to find out how members and casual riders differ in their use of Cyclistic services, and to find casual users that are the best candidates for conversion to members. The marketing team at Cyclistic is to leverage this knowledge to create a marketing campaign to that end.
